Garbages are omnipresent in today's society and many recyclable trash end up being thrown away and left untreated. In many countries, people are asked to sort their trash according to some categories, but depending on where, it is more or less done. Automatically recognizing and then separating all kinds of trash can make the task of treating garbages much easier.
Thus, this RAMP challenge is about image classification of 6 kinds of trash:
cardboard, glass, metal, paper, plastic, and the last class is composed of other kinds of trash.
